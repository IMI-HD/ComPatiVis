# ScR_VisTechniques
## Description
This visual literature collection was created as part of a scoping review on the topic of visualization techniques of time-oriented data for the 
comparison of single patients to multiple patients or cohorts. Our literature collection provides a selection of attributes to see the usage of specific 
visualization techniques and enables cross-filtering to identify systems combining a set of attributes such as medical context, visualization, and patient entities.

## Interactive Version
The interactive version is hosted with GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://imi-hd.github.io/ScR_VisTechniques/).

## SurVis
This visualization was created with SurVis by Fabian Beck and can be recreated using [these](https://github.com/fabian-beck/survis) instructions.
